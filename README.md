The HUST Transmission System Dataset was collected based on the SQI experimental platform. This dataset contains four-channel vibration sensor signals corresponding to 14 health states of a mechanical transmission system, obtained through fault simulation experiments. The dataset is publicly available, and anyone may use it to validate fault diagnosis algorithms. If this dataset is used in any publication, please cite the following paper:
